[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ezbash.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/ezbash)

ezbash (yes, it's uncapitalized on purpose) is a tool created to help people ease their way into using the MacOS or Linux terminal, that most powerful of applications.

##Installation
As your first step into learning bash, enter this into your terminal:
```bash
gem install ezbash
```
*Note:* You may have to tack "sudo" onto the begining of the above command to get the program to install. If you get an error code like "Permision denied", you will need to do this.

##Usage
To run the application, enter this into the terminal:
```
ezbash
```
Then, list possible commands by entering "help" and get started! Have fun!

##Uninstallation
To uninstall the program, enter this into your terminal:
```bash
gem uninstall ezbash
```
*Note:* Again, if you get an error like "Permision denied", put the word "sudo" at the begining of the command.
