# ezbash
ezbash (yes, it's uncapitalized on purpose) is way to ease your way into using the MacOS or Linux terminal, that most powerful of applications so, lets get started!

##Installation

##Usage
You will be greeted by a prompt asking which operating system you use. If you use a Linux other than the ones listed, look at that distributors website or on Wikipedia and you should be able to find out the overarching distro (it's probably Debian). Then, list possible commands by entering "help" and get started! Have fun!
