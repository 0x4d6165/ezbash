# ezbash
ezbash (yes, it's uncapitalized on purpose) is a tool created to help people ease their way into using the MacOS* or Linux terminal, that most powerful of applications.

*As of right now, MacOS cannot install applications. I apologize for this shortcoming.
##Installation
As your first step into the terminal, enter this into your terminal:
```
gem install ezbash
```

##Usage
To run the application, type this into the terminal:
```
ezbash
```
Then, list possible commands by entering "help" and get started! Have fun!
